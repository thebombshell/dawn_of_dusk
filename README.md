# Dawn Of Dusk

An exercise in data driven game design. The concept of Dawn Of Dusk is to produce a post apocolyptic RPG Sandbox. The Sandbox formed of sparse data structures and a low cost tick based simulation is intended to be written for server operation, clients would then interpret the sparse data view of the Sandbox and skin the data as they see fit.
